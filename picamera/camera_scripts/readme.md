# scripts to do image capture with picamera -- 20180831

* low_light.py -- low light image capture - needs some fucking around with to do settings on command line
* rgb_images.py -- makes rgb images - basically raw format
* image_to_array.py -- sends output to numpy array - don't use this yet. Need to edit to send output to fits file
