## Spectral response curves:

* Grabbed spectral response curves from https://github.com/khufkens/pi-camera-response-curves

* Look similar to the ones in Pagnutti et al. (2017), but they don't include their data.

* TODO: 
  - Compare phot filters to Pi response curves.
  - Get response curve for NoIR camera
