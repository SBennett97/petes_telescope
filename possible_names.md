# Ideas for names

## Rules for telescope names should follow guidelines set out here: [Dumb Or Overly Forced Astronomical Acronyms Site (or DOOFAAS)](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~gpetitpas/Links/Astroacro.html)

* Some kind of SOAP acronym (from Ben)
* SOAP Telescope -- **S**loan's **O**ptical **A**stronomical **P**i-powered Telescope
* SOAP -- **S**outhern **O**bservatory of **A**stro**P**hysics (from Leo)
* MOTH -- **M**ini **O**bservatory of ba**TH** (from Eliot)
* TUBS -- **T**elescope **U**nder the **B**ath **S**ky (from Misty), Slogan: “Bath TUBS: where starlight showers down”
* BIANCA -- needs an overly forced acronym otherwise my brain associates it with Figure 1.
